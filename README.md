French Tarot
------------


This is a java implementation of the [French Tarot game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_tarot).


Yet to be implemented:
- Special rules (Petit at the end, Excuse at the end, poignee, etc...)
- Placement of the card on the fold according to their respective players
- Card visibility (should probably implemented with an AI, or multiple views )


Otherwise, the game should be complete.
