French Tarot
------------


This is a java implementation of the French Tarot game.
For rules, check wikipedia.

Yet to be implemented:
- Special rules (Petit at the end, Excuse at the end, poignee, etc...)
- Placement of the card on the fold according to their respective players
- Card visibility (should probably implemented with an AI, or multiple views )


Otherwise, the game should be complete.
